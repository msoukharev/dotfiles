# Dotfiles

## Context

My primary machine is a Mac. All my other remote servers run Debian. For all of these environments, I use zsh as my primary shell.

My terminal workflow includes API endpoint exploration, light automation scripting and administering my remote servers, including the web server that hosts my website.

## Why?

Everyone needs to work in a terminal, me included. At first, I used a builtin macOS terminal. Later, I switched to iTerm for more capabilities and builtin tmux, which proved to be very useful in administering my remote servers. Then, I wanted even more customization.

[Oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) proved to be unnecessarily complex for me, though. Nevertheless, it served as an inspiration for this project.
